We've already set up a user account, so let's log in to see if the page works. Go to 
http://localhost:8000/admin/. If you're still logged in as an admin, look for a logout link in
the header and click it.

When you're logged out, go to http://localhost:8000/users/login/. You should see a simple login
page. Enter the username and password you setup earlier, and you should be brough back to the
index page. The header on the hom,e page should display a greeting personalized with your 
username.
