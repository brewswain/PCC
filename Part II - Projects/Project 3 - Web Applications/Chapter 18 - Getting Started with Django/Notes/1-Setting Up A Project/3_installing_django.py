"""
Once the virtual environment is activated, enter the following to install Django:
"""

pip install django

"""
Because we're working in a virtual environment, which is its own self-contained environment,
this command is the same on all systems. there's no need to use the --user flag, and there's 
no need to use longer commands, such as "python -m pip install package_name"

Keep in mind that Django will be available only when the ll_env environment is active.
