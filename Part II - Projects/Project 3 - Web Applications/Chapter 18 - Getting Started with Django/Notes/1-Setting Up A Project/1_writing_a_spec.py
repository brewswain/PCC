"""
When beginning a project, you first need to describe the project in a specification, or spec.
Then you'll set up a virtual environment in which to build the project.

A full spec details the project goals, describes the project's functionality, and discusses
its appearance and user interface. Like any good project or business plan, a spec should 
keep you focused and help keep your project on track. We won't write a full project spec here,
but we'll lay out a few clear goals to keep the development process focused. Here's the spec
we'll use:

=============================================================================
|   We'll write a web app called Learning Log that allows users to log the  | 
|   topics they're interested in and to make journal entries as they learn  |
|   about each topic.                                                       |
|   The Learning Log home page will describe the site and invite users to   |
|   either register or log in. Once logged in, a user can create new topics |
|   add new entries, and read and edit existing entries.                    |
=============================================================================

When you learn about a new topic, keeping a journal of what you've learned can be helpful in
tracking and revisiting information. A good app makes this process efficient.
