"""
You can test many features of the game simply by running the game, but some features are
tedious to test in the normal version of a game. For example, it's a lot of work to shoot down
every alien on the screen multiple times to test if your code responds to an empty fleet 
correctly. 

To test particular features, you can change certain game settings to focus on a particular area. 
For example, you might shrink the screen so there are fewer aliens to shoot down or increase the 
bullet speed and give yourself lots of bullets at once.

Changes like these will help you test the game more efficiently and possibly spark ideas for 
giving players bonus powers. (Just remember to restore the settings to normal once you're 
finished testing a feature.)
