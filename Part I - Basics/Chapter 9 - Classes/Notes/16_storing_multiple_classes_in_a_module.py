"""
You can store as many classes as you need in a single module, although
each class in a module should be related somehow. The classes Battery
and ElectricCar both help represent cars, so let's add them to the 
module car.py.

Now we can make a new file called my_electric_car.py, import the
ElectricCar class, and make an electric car. Please look in the 
modules folder for access to my_electric_car.py.
