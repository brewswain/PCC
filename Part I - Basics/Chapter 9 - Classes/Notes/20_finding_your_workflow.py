"""
Python gives you many options for how to structure code in a large
project. It's important to know all these possibilities so you can
determine the best ways to organize your projects as well as understand
other people's projects.

When you're starting out, keep your code structure simple. Try doing 
everything in one file and moving your classes to separate modules
once everything is working. If you like how modules and files interact,
try storing your classes in modules when you start a project. Find an
approach that lets you write code that works, and go from there.
