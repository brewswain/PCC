# A conditional test, in its most basic form, checks whether the value of a variable is equal to the value of interest
# eg:
# >> > car = 'bmw'
# >> > car == 'bmw'
# True

"""
After setting the value of car to 'bmw' by using the singular equal sign, the second line (car == 'bmw') checks whether the value of car is 'bmw' by using ( == )
This operator returns either True or False, depending on if they match or not.
