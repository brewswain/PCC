"""
In the greet_user function shown in 1_define_a_function.py,
we defined greet_user() to require a value for the variable username.
Once we called the function and gave it the information, it printed the
right greeting.

The variable 'username'  in the definition of greet_user() is an example
of a parameter, a piece of information the function needs to do its job.
The value 'jesse' in greet_username('jesse') is an example of an argument.
An argument is a piece of information that's passed from a function call 
to a function itself.

Some people speak of arguments and parameters interchangeably, 
so keep that in mind.
