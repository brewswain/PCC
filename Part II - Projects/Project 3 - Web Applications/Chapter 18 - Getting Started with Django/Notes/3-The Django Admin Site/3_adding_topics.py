"""
Now that Topic has been registered with the admin site, let's add our first topic. Click 
Topics to go to the Topics page, which is mostly empty, because we have no topics to manage
yet.
Click Add Topic, and a form for adding a new topic appears. Enter Chess in the first box and
click save. You'll be sent back to the Topics admin page, and you'll see the topic you just
created.

Let's create a second topic so we'll have more data to work with. Click Add Topic again, and
enter Rock Climbing. Click Save, and you'll be sent back to the main Topics page again. Now 
you'll see Chess and Rock Climbing listed.
