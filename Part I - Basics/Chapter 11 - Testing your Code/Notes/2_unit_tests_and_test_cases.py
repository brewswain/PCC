"""
The module unittest from the Python standard library provides tools for
testing your code. A unit test verifies that one specific aspect of a 
funciton's behaviour is correct. A test case is a collection of unit tests
that together prove that a function behaves as it's supposed to, within the 
full range of situations you expect it to handle. 

A good test case considers all the possible kinds of input a function could 
receive and includes tests to represent each of these situations. A test 
case with full coverage includes a full range of unit tests covering all
the possible ways you can use a function. Achieving full coverage on a large
project can be daunting. It's often good enough to write tests for your code's 
critical behaviours and then aim for full coverage only if the projects starts 
to see widespread use.
