"""
When you write a function or a class, you can also write tests for that
code. ATesting proves that your code works as it's supposed to in response
to tall the unput types it's designed to receive. When you write tests, you
can be confident that your code will work correctly as more people begin
to use your programs. You'll also be able to test new code asa you add it to 
make sure your changes don't break your program's existing behaviour. Every
programmer makes mistakes, so every programmer must test their code often,
catching problems before users encounter them.

In this chapter you'll learn to test your code using toolsin Python's unittest 
module. You'll learn to build a test case and check that a set of inputs result
in the output you want. You'll see what a passing test looks like and what a
failing test looks like, and you'll learn how a failing test can help you 
improve your code. You'll learn to test functions and classes, and you'll start
to understand how many tests to write for a project.
