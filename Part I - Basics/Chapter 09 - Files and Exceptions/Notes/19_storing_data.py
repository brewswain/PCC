"""
Many of your programs will ask users to input certain kinds of information.
You might allow users to store preferences in a game or provide data for a
visualisation. Whatever the focus of your program is, you'll store the 
information users provide in data structures such as lists and dictionaries.
When users close a program, you'll almost always want to save the information
they entered. A simple way to do this involves storing your data using the
json module.

The json module allows you to dump simple Python data structures into a file
and load the data from that file the next time the program runs. You can also
use json to share data between different Python programs. Even better, the 
JSON data format is not specific to Python, so you can share data you store
in the JSON format with people who work in many other programming languages. 
It's a useful and portable format, and it's easy to learn.

The JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) format was originally developed for
JavaScript. However, it has since become a common format used by many languages,
including Python.
