# Python Crash Course progress log

I recently lost most of my progress for this book, so I am temporarily storing this information here, and will wipe once i'm back to my previous level/Once I find an alternative to using github for something like this.

This is a way for me to mark my progress of reading Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes, whilst also providing easy reference points for me to return to for revision purposes.
